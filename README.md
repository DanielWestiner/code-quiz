# Animal Trivia Quiz

## Description

This project was to create a webpage showcasing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that enables the webpage to load a dynamically updated code quiz game. This responsive interface was created to feature a quiz game about animal facts. As the user clicks start, a countdown timer begins and trivia questions appear. For every correct answer to each question, 1 point is added to the user's score and for every wrong answer 0 points are awarded for that round of question and additionall 10 seconds are taken off of the clock. As the countdown hits 0, the game is over. Or, if the user answers all five questions, the game is also over. When the game is finished the user will be prompted to enter their initials for record keeping and to see their final score.
